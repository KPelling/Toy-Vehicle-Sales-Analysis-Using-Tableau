# Toy-Vehicle-Sales-Analysis-Using-Tableau

As the final project for my Tableau course, I was tasked with coming up with a business problem that needed to be solved by analyzing a dataset and creating a series of visualizations with Tableau.  Because I have a background in supply chain management and forecasting, I thought it would make sense to do a forecasting project using a sales history dataset.  I found my dataset on Kaggle, and it included three years worth of sales data for a company that manufactured toy vehicles.  I set out to predict the overall sales forecast for the following year, as well as the demanded number of units in each category.  I used Tableau's forecasting feature, which was not part of the course, but I figured it out on my own and produced charts to display the aforementioned forecasts. I also grouped the sales data by country in order to determine which country had the highest sales, and which countries would be good target markets for expansion.
